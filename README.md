# Stop Yapping

Welcome to **Stop Yapping**, the no-nonsense website designed to encourage people to stop saying unnecessary, random, or annoying stuff! It's a humorous, blunt reminder that nobody asked for those "skibidi toilet" rants or "sigma grindset" vibes when all we need is a simple "Hey" or "Whatâ€™s up?"

---

### Features

- **Blunt message**: Tells people to stop saying unnecessary things.
- **Example list**: Displays a list of things that nobody needed to hear.
- **Positive alternatives**: Offers better alternatives to unnecessary chatter.
- **Buttons**:
  - **"Keep Yapping"**: Takes you to **stopyapping.net**.
  - **"Nah, I'd win"**: A Rickroll button that redirects to the classic Rick Astley video.
